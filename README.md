MNIST NumberClassification

Description: The objective of this project is to gain hands-on experience with machine learning techniques by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the MNIST Fashion dataset. The goal is to accurately classify fashion items into their respective categories. To optimize the performance of the model, several training parameters have been explored, including adjustments to padding and the number of filters. The dataset underwent preprocessing steps, such as normalization, to enhance the accuracy of the model. The "ModelTrainer.py" script manages the process of training the model, which includes loading the dataset, training the model, and saving the final model as a ".h5" file. The current accuracy of the model is 94.5% for the training set and 90.2% for the testing set.

Instructions:
1. Install python 3.10 (or above)
2. Install the required modules with pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run file ModelTrainer.py to train the model
4. Run file ModelTester.py to test the model
